        <p style="color: rgba(226,232,240,0.92); line-height:1.55;">
          Boss Meter is a fun, lightweight website designed for entertainment purposes.
          It generates a randomized "boss level" score meant to be playful and motivational,
          not a scientific or psychological measurement.
        </p>

        <p style="color: rgba(226,232,240,0.92); line-height:1.55;">
          This site is an independent project created to explore simple web interactions,
          clean design, and engaging user experiences. No account is required, and no personal
          data is collected directly by the site.
