    </header>

    <p>Boss Meter is a simple entertainment app. It does not require an account.</p>

    <p>
      Boss Meter itself does not collect or store personal information. However, the app may display advertisements
      provided by Google (for example, Google AdMob) only when the user explicitly chooses to view ads by pressing the
      “Boss Commercials” button.
    </p>

    <h2>Ads &amp; Advertising Identifiers</h2>

    <p>
      When ads are shown, Google and its partners may collect and use advertising identifiers and related technologies
      to serve ads, including personalized or non-personalized ads, depending on your device settings and applicable
      consent choices.
    </p>

    <p>Ads are never shown automatically and appear only after a direct user action.</p>

    <p>
      You can manage ad personalization in your Google account and device settings (for example, Google Ads Settings).
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
      Boss Meter uses third-party services provided by Google, which may collect information as described in their own
      privacy policies. We encourage you to review Google’s advertising and privacy practices for more details.
